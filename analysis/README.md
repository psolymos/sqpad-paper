# SQPAD Analysis

This folder contains scripts to reproduce results from Lele and Solymos.

The R Markdown file was used for producing the Online Supplement.

The `00-functions-sqpad.R` file contains functions for fitting and 
summarizing SQPAD models to data. Note that SQPAD is available as part
of the detect R package (<https://github.com/psolymos/detect>).

The bSims R package was used for conducting in-silico simulations
(<https://github.com/psolymos/bSims>).
